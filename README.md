## Inspiration
We want a more sustainable way for individuals to travel from point A to point B, by sharing a ride.

## What it does
It allows users to post their routes to a carpool request board for other users (drivers) to see and potentially accept. We decided that it should be aimed at students because of security reasons and to build a more tight-knit user base to begin with.

## How we built it
We brainstormed to create our Figma prototype and then started building the front-end. Once we were done that we started on the backend connections.

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting the backend and the frontend

## What if we had more time?
We wanted to add a chat system so that the users can communicate within the app.
Allow users to filter the requests page based on the current location area.
